# ra-operators
Fundamental RA operators implemented in java

This project is actually a series of projects done as part of Database Management Systems (CSCI 6370) @ UGA. We in team of 
five students implemented fundamental Database operators like select, project, join, union and minus. Later, Indexing was also
added with data structures like Bplus tree and Linear Hashmap. 

I have worked exclusively on join operation and indexing on Linear Hashmap data structure.

## How to run
Compile this program using sbt (simple build tool). While in the project directory, do the follow:
     - sbt clean
	   - sbt compile run
	    
You will be prompted to select a main function. 
	    	  
		 - MovieDB.java
		 - LinHashMap.java
		 - BpTreeMap.java
		 - KeyType.java

Their respective main methods test their class' various functionality.
